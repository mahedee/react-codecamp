This is the sample application for the Building React Apps with TypeScript course, at Pluralsight.

The API is available at /api.

The example app used in the course is available at /app.

For the first module about updating an application to use TypeScript, check out the main branch for a default implementation of the app written in javascript. You can use this project (or any javascrit project you have) to start with.

The second module covering class and function components is located from the m3-class-and-function-components branch to start, and the completed example is in the m3-class-and-function-components-final branch.

The last module follows the same pattern, with the initial starting point in the m4-declaring-and-using-hooks-with-typescript branch and the final code in the \*-final branch.
